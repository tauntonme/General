Here you may find all work on design and build of electronic hardware used in the West Buckland Railway Signalling Systems.

July 2023 - Two circuit boards have been designed and built, a 'Controller Core Module' and an 'I/O Expansion Module'.
The 'Core' module hosts one ST Nucleo L432KC controller module configured to communicate using CAN bus, RS232, USB and SPI, with external EEPROM. Powered by a single 24V 1.5A PSU, this board is designed to connect via 16 way ribbon cable / IDC connectors to one I/O Expansion Module to provide 16 each buffered inputs and outputs, sufficiently robust to be wired around the site, capable of withstanding more than any foreseeable abuse.
I/O Expansion modules may be daisy-chained for greater numbers of I/O.
